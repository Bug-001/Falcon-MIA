### ATTACK-SPECIFIC PARAMETERS ###

# Inquiry attack parameters
inquiry_template: "Have you seen the question before: \"{input}\" Answer in one word, yes or no."  # Template for inquiry attack
positive_keywords:    # Keywords indicating model has seen the input
  - "yes"
  - "asked"
  - "encountered"
  - "similar"
  - "familiar"
  - "remember"
  - "recognize"

  - "unfamiliar"
  - "don't remember"
  - "cannot recall"

# Repeat attack parameters
num_words: 5    # Number of words to provide (0 means half of the sentence)
repeat_template: "Now you are an expert of sentence completion based on questions you have seen. Complete the following sentence to the end of the question, and do not ask any other words and the given sentence pieces. Example: <Input> \"The quick brown\" <Output> \"fox jumps over the lazy dog.\" Your task: <Input> \"{input}\" <Output> "  # Template for repeat attack

# Brainwash attack parameters
max_misleadings: 15       # Maximum number of misleading examples
num_wrong_labels: 3       # Number of wrong labels to use

# Obfuscation attack parameters
max_obfuscation_level: 1              # Maximum level of obfuscation
num_obfuscation_levels: 5             # Number of obfuscation levels to test
num_similarities: 8                   # Number of similarity measures to use
nlp_dataset: "en_core_web_md"         # NLP dataset for language processing
technique: "character_swap"           # Obfuscation technique to use, options: "character_swap", "synonym_replacement", "leet_speak", "similar_char_substitution"
sim_use_idf: true                     # Whether to use IDF in similarity calculation
obf_use_idf: false                    # Whether to use IDF in obfuscation
selected_obf_text: "all"              # Which part of text to obfuscate: "all", "input", "output", "longest"

# Template for obfuscation attack
obsfucation_attack_template: "You are a novice text decryptor, who find the decryption only from the previously given information. Your task is to deobfuscate the given text even it does not look like obfuscated. Follow these instructions carefully:

1. Read the obfuscated text provided below.
2. You should obfuscate texts by matching the given obfuscated text with the paragraphs and sentences you have seen just now.
3. If you can match the given obfuscated text with similar previous texts (original texts), your output should be the original texts. The original texts may contain multiple sentences from different paragraphs and roles.
4. If you cannot match the given obfuscated text with similar previous texts, you should tell that you cannot decrypt the text.
5. Provide only the deobfuscated text as your final response. Do not include any prompts, explanations, reasoning, or additional information in the final output.

Remember, if you are able to deobfuscate, your final output should only contain the deobfuscated text, without any other prompt. You should only use the information you have seen to deobfuscate the text. The obfuscated text is:

{input}"
